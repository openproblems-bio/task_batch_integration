      label: CiLISI
      summary: Cell-type aware version of iLISI (Local inverse Simpson's Index).
                iLISI is computed separately for each cell type or cluster, normalized between 0 and 1, and averaged across all cells (global mean).
                By default, CiLISI is calculated only for groups with at least 10 cells and 2 distinct batch labels (configurable).
      description: |
        ciLISI measures batch mixing in a cell type-aware manner by computing iLISI within each cell type and normalizing
        the scores between 0 and 1. Unlike iLISI, ciLISI preserves sensitivity to biological variance and avoids favoring
        overcorrected datasets with removed cell type signals.

      summary: As CiLISI, but returns mean of per-group CiLISI values (i.e., average of the means per group). instead of a global average.
