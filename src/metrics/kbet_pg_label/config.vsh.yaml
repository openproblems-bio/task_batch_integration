      summary: kBET algorithm to determine how well batches are mixed within a cell
        type
      description: |
        The kBET algorithm (v.0.99.6, release 4c9dafa) determines whether the label composition
        of a k nearest neighborhood of a cell is similar to the expected (global) label
        composition (Buettner et al., Nat Meth 2019). The test is repeated for a random subset
        of cells, and the results are summarized as a rejection rate over all tested
        neighborhoods.

        This implementation uses the `pegasus.calc_kBET` function per cell type and the rejection
        rate is averaged over all cell types.

        In Open Problems we do not run kBET on graph outputs to avoid computation-intensive
        diffusion processes being run.
