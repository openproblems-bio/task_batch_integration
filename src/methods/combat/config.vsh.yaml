summary: Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes
  methods
description: |
  "An Empirical Bayes (EB) approach to correct for batch effects. It
  estimates batch-specific parameters by pooling information across genes in
  each batch and shrinks the estimates towards the overall mean of the batch
  effect estimates across all genes. These parameters are then used to adjust
  the data for batch effects, leading to more accurate and reproducible
  results."
