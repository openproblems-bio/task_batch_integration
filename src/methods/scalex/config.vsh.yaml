summary: Online single-cell data integration through projecting heterogeneous datasets
  into a common cell-embedding space
description: |
  SCALEX is a method for integrating heterogeneous single-cell data online using a VAE framework. Its generalised encoder disentangles batch-related components from batch-invariant biological components, which are then projected into a common cell-embedding space.
