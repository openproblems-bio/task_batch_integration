summary: Accurate semi-supervised integration of single-cell transcriptomics data
description: |
  STACAS is a method for scRNA-seq integration,
  especially suited to accurately integrate datasets with large cell type imbalance
  (e.g. in terms of proportions of distinct cell populations).
  Prior cell type knowledge, given as cell type labels, can be provided to the algorithm to perform
  semi-supervised integration, leading to increased preservation of biological variability
  in the resulting integrated space.
  STACAS is robust to incomplete cell type labels and can be applied to large-scale integration tasks.
