summary: Efficient integration of heterogeneous single-cell transcriptomes using Scanorama
description: |
  Scanorama enables batch-correction and integration of heterogeneous scRNA-seq datasets.
  It is designed to be used in scRNA-seq pipelines downstream of noise-reduction methods,
  including those for imputation and highly-variable gene filtering. The results from
  Scanorama integration and batch correction can then be used as input to other tools
  for scRNA-seq clustering, visualization, and analysis.
