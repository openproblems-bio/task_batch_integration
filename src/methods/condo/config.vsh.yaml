summary: "ConDo is a feature transformation method for batch correction based on matching conditional distributions."
description: |
  Confounded Domain Adaptation (ConDo) is a batch correction method that performs a linear transformation to features, to match their conditional distribution given biological variables of interest.
  It will first learn (nonlinear) a conditional generative model for each batch, of the features given biological variables.
  Then, it finds a linear feature transformation, either affine or location-scale, that minimizes the expected divergence between the conditional distributions.
