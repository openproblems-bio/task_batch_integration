summary: "A foundation model for single-cell biology (zero shot)"
description: |
  scGPT is a foundation model for single-cell biology based on a generative
  pre-trained transformer and trained on a repository of over 33 million cells.

  Here, we use zero-shot output from a pre-trained model to get an integrated
  embedding for the batch integration task.
