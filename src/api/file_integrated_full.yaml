summary: An integrated AnnData dataset with additional outputs.
description: |
  Must contain at least one of:

    - Feature: the corrected_counts layer
    - Embedding: the X_emb obsm
    - Graph: the connectivities and distances obsp

  The Graph should always be present, but the Feature and Embedding are optional.
