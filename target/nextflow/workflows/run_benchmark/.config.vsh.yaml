  summary: "Remove unwanted batch effects from scRNA-seq data while retaining biologically\
    \ meaningful variation."
  description: "As single-cell technologies advance, single-cell datasets are growing\
    \ both in size and complexity.\nEspecially in consortia such as the Human Cell\
    \ Atlas, individual studies combine data from multiple labs, each sequencing multiple\
    \ individuals possibly with different technologies.\nThis gives rise to complex\
    \ batch effects in the data that must be computationally removed to perform a\
    \ joint analysis.\nThese batch integration methods must remove the batch effect\
    \ while not removing relevant biological information.\nCurrently, over 200 tools\
    \ exist that aim to remove batch effects scRNA-seq datasets [@zappia2018exploring].\n\
    These methods balance the removal of batch effects with the conservation of nuanced\
    \ biological information in different ways.\nThis abundance of tools has complicated\
    \ batch integration method choice, leading to several benchmarks on this topic\
    \ [@luecken2022benchmarking; @tran2020benchmark; @chazarragil2021flexible; @mereu2020benchmarking].\n\
    Yet, benchmarks use different metrics, method implementations and datasets. Here\
    \ we build a living benchmarking task for batch integration methods with the vision\
    \ of improving the consistency of method evaluation.\n\nIn this task we evaluate\
    \ batch integration methods on their ability to remove batch effects in the data\
    \ while conserving variation attributed to biological effects.\nAs input, methods\
    \ require either normalised or unnormalised data with multiple batches and consistent\
    \ cell type labels.\nThe batch integrated output can be a feature matrix, a low\
    \ dimensional embedding and/or a neighbourhood graph.\nThe respective batch-integrated\
    \ representation is then evaluated using sets of metrics that capture how well\
    \ batch effects are removed and whether biological variance is conserved.\nWe\
    \ have based this particular task on the latest, and most extensive benchmark\
    \ of single-cell data integration methods.\n"
